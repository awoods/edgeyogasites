		<b>Sasha-Vanessa found yoga in 1995 after suffering knee surgery and 
		back pain in a skiing accident. She was an aerobics instructor teaching 
		mindless hours of step, boxing, and sculpt classes. Embarking on her 
		yoga journey, her initial interest was ashtanga yoga because of its 
		physically-demanding quick-paced class structure. Then she wanted to 
		deepen her daily practice with hatha style and slow down her racing mind 
		(and body!). Pilates-Mat and Pilates-Reformer were part of her exercise 
		routine to rehabilitate her aching back, having suffered three herniated 
		disks and a torn ligament and meniscus in her left knee. <br>
		<br>
		Sasha-Vanessa found daily meditation as a way to find a tranquil mind 
		and a healthier body image. In 2000, she took her first yoga teacher 
		training with Bryan Kest. She's come a long way, completing a 200-hour 
		vinyasa yoga teacher training with Tranquil Space Yoga in Washington, DC 
		and another 300-hour samayama yoga teacher training and personal 
		training certification with CityFitness in Washington, DC. Her sources 
		of inspiration are her students, Shiva Rea, Bryan and Johnny Kest, and 
		Baron Baptiste. Her passion for pilates encouraged her to walk, run and 
		participate in marathons, half-marathons and ten-mile races pain-free.<br>
		<br>
		She credits her self-practice of yoga and pilates and teaching (pilates-mat 
		and pilates reformer) classes as her &quot;saving grace&quot; mentally and 
		physically. She is hopeful to share her uplifting and happy spirit with 
		all of those who practice yoga with her and enjoy her classes. Sasha-Vanessa 
		incorporates meditation, vinyasa yoga and pilates in her life as a way 
		to maintain balance and peace. </b><br>
