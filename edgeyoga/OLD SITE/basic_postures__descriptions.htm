	<p align="center"><b>Easy Posture or Sukhasana</b></p>
	<p>Sit cross-legged with the heel of one foot in front of the ankle of the 
	other foot with hands on knees.&nbsp; Stay slightly extended through your 
	spine and evenly push both sides of the pelvis into the floor. Allow the 
	knees to gently lower. Use a blanket under the hips if your knees are more 
	than 6 inches off the mat, this will help support extension through your 
	spine. </div>

	<p align="center"><b>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog)</b></p>
	<p>Start on your hands and knees. Keep your legs about hip width apart and 
	your arms shoulder width apart. Spread your fingers attempting to press 
	through the base of knuckles while keeping fingers pointing straight ahead. 
	Externally rotate the shoulders by trying to turn the inside of your elbows 
	forward. Keep the instep of your feet parallel with the soles of the feet 
	drawing down toward the mat. Draw your spine toward 
	the front of your thighs (extending the spine slightly). The goal is to 
	lengthen the spine while keeping your legs straight and your feet flat on 
	the ground. In the beginning bend the knees a bit and and keep your 
	heels raised in order to relieve some of the pressure from your hamstrings, 
	which if tight, can cause spinal flexion. The important thing is to work on 
	lengthening the spine. Keep your shoulders drawing from your ears by 
	retracting your shoulder blades (this will also help keep the spine slightly 
	extended). </div>

	<p align="center"><b>Uttanasana (Standing Forward Fold)</b></p>
	<p>Flex from the hips, bring the arms forward and down toward the floor. 
	Visualize spilling the pelvis forward, as you fold attempt to stay extended 
	(straight) through the spine. Try to keep the knees extended and the spine 
	straight, using blocks under the hands or placing the hands on your thighs 
	or shins to help support the torso and maintain a light spinal extension.</div>
