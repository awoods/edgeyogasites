					Theatre—which she co-directed with her husband Didier 
					Rousselet—a highly physical, French-American professional 
					movement theatre in Rosslsyn, VA. She has practiced yoga 
					intensively over the past six years and became a Yoga 
					Alliance certified yoga instructor in 2008. Monica’s sincere 
					desire is to bring to others—through the practice of 
					yoga—better health to the body, more focus to the mind and 
					lasting peace to the spirit. With 20 years of teaching 
					experience (teaching mathematics teachers), she values 
					pedagogy—the art and science of teaching. She’s known for 
					her clear and articulate instructions intended to help 
					students make the best of their yoga experience—and enjoy 
					it! She sees a yoga practice as a moving meditation. 
					Monica’s exposure to many cultures, mastery of several 
					languages, professional involvement in both the arts 
					(theatre) and the sciences (mathematics), and her growing 
					knowledge of alternative healing methods and mind-body 
					medicine provide her with a unique perspective on the
