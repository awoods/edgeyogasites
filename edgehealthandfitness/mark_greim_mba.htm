	<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Angel Stone is the 
	Chief Executive Officer of Eshe Body Center. Her training philosophy stems 
	from a lifetime of fitness and adventure. At the age of 6, she won her first 
	foot race. That sprint across the playground started her running career and 
	culminated in her first marathon (not a sprint). Motivated by that 
	accomplishment, Angel went on to win a slot on the rowing team at the 
	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After graduation, she became an 
	officer in the United States Army. It was there that her love for fitness 
	reached its height. The military gave her a greater appreciation for life 
	and taught her to live every day to the fullest. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">A nationally certified 
	personal trainer and group exercise instructor, Angel maintains a rigorous 
	fitness regimen. In addition, Angel is an active member of the dance 
	community. She has performed internationally and also danced with a popular 
	hip hop company. If you look closely, Angel can still be seen dancing and 
	teaching hip hop classes throughout Metro DC. </font></p>
